# bar-graph
Java swing application for bar graphs. One frame containing number fields, and another frame containing their bar graph representation. 
The Observer pattern is being implemented here.

- Entering a number on the number fields updates the graph
- Clicking on any part of the graph will update the graph as well as the number fields
